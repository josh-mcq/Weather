use a python generator as the thing that's taking the data input and turning that into the data stream.

A sine wave is sort of the base.

how will i deliver it and what will i deliver via the sdk?

I need to install the arduino ide.

The installing of the neosensory library was a little different because i'm using the web editor. 

So that's installed. But looking at the arduino editor, and the connect_and_vibrate example, that's mostly just using the arduino to send arbitrary signals to the buzz.  But what is the entry point if I have some python code to determine the rumble frames?

what is circuitPython?

arduino ide preferences -> CMD+, (command and comma)
in prefernces, add this url: 
https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json

which i got from https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Unofficial-list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls
did the board install of Adafruit nRF52

tasks(to put into trello:
[]get arduino board work(able to execute a sketch)
[]flash a sketch to the board and get it to run
[]get pressure sensor to send a stream to the board in a format that I can access the info I want
[]get light sensor to send a stream to the board in a format that I can access the info I want
[]get temp/humidty sensor to send a stream to the board in a format that I can access the info I want
[]buy wind sensor
[]get wind sensor to send a stream to the board in a format that I can access the info I want
[]Read https://realpython.com/arduino-python/ & get board to run a python script
[]get the arduino to interact with the buzz
[]get all the data streams in order enough to combine them all in the most rudimentary way and process []that into a signal relayed to the buzz machine.
[]finish the algorithm!
